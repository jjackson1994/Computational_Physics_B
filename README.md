### Project: Binary Black Hole Time Delay Distribution
Binary systems are currently a exciting in astrophysics. With LIGO and VIRGO measuring experimental data from gravity waves, theoretical predictions can finally be tested. In this investigation the focus is kept to binary black holes (BBH). Simulated data has been provided data on around 87 million BBH systems. In the simulation each BBH began its life as a binary star system. The time delay is the time taken from the formation of the binary star system to the peak of the merging rate of the BBH system. 
  
The machine learning aspect of this project was conducted using sklearn and XGBoost. Data optimization  was invaluable and managed allow the full data to be used even on a mid range single machine.
